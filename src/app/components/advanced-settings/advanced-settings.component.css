/* The Material Design accordion component is made up of a series of expansion
panels that can be opened and closed by clicking on their header.
Each expansion panel has a border radius applied to its top corners,
which gives it a rounded appearance. However, when the first expansion panel is opened,
the border radius on its top corners clashes with the border radius of the accordion
container, causing a visual issue. To fix this, we can remove the border radius on
the top-right and top-left corners of the first expansion panel using
the :first-of-type selector. This selector targets only the first expansion panel in
the accordion container, ensuring that the border radius is removed only from the
first panel and not from the other panels. In summary, the code snippet is a targeted
solution that removes the border radius on the top corners of the first expansion panel
in a Material Design accordion component, preventing a visual issue when the first panel is opened. */
